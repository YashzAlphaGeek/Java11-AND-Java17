# Java11-AND-Java17

For Java 11 we need to download Amazon Corretto - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html
Corretto is a distribution of Open JDK with patches included by Amazon that are not yet integrated in the corresponding OpenJDK update projects. We focus on patches that improve performance or stability in OpenJDK, chosen based on Amazon's observations running large services.
